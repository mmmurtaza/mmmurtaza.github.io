    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>Hello everybody, I am doing what I am preaching. ;) </p>
    <h2>Projects Worked on</h2>
    <p>Currently I am working on <a href="http://attendance.masakin.co.in">attendance.masakin.co.in</a> </p>
    In the past I have worked on
    <ul>
        <li>janah.local</li>
        <li>maskasin.co.in</li>
        <li>talabulilm.com</li>
        <li>And other odd jobs...</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Text Editor</h2>
    <p>Currently I am using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">vscode</a>. I also like sublime text. And also tried Brackets for a bit.<br>
    I really like Notepad++ too, but its a shame it is windows only. 
    </p>

    <h2>IDEs</h2>
    <p>I started as a Visual Basic programer, So (obviously) I lived off of Visual Studio since version 4 to 6.
    <br>
    However after .Net I shifted to the AMP stack. Used Netbeans for a while. Even tried PhpStorm for a bit.
    </p>

    <p>.Net hosting was very expensive (just about a few years ago). And Apache mysql and php AMP stack hosting was and still is 
        relatively cheap.
